# TeamSKT-Feedback-Prize---Predicting-Effective-Arguments-2nd-Place-solution

This is the repo that contains all code/notebooks needed to reproduce the 2nd place logloss solution and 3rd place efficiency solution of the  Feedback-Prize---Predicting-Effective-Arguments competition.


``solution.pdf`` has a pdf describing our solution with references.  

# Solution of team members

Detailed instructions of how to reproduce our solution can be found in the following sources:

1. Tom's solution can be found in ``Tom_solution`` <br />
2. Shujun's solution can be found in ``Shujun_solution`` <br />
3. Kkiller prefers to keep his solution in a seprate github repo: https://github.com/neroksi/fprize-eff-2nd-place
